Rock Creek Zendo is also the home of Myo Shin Osho (Curt) and his wife Beth. We are located just north of Norbeck Road (St. Rd. 28) on the east side of Rockville. The number there is 301-603-8181. The map below shows a bird's eye view - please call or email for more detailed directions. Since this is a private residence we don't post our address publicly - also we ask that people only come during times that are publicly advertised for classes, meditation groups, retreats and other activities. If you want to arrange to meet with Myo Shin or visit the Zendo at any other time, please call or email prior to coming. 
<font color=#ffffff>If you are coming to the Monday night or Saturday morning meditation group for the first time</font> please be sure to arrange for an orientation
at least two days ahead of time.
