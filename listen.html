 "I've been studying Chinese characters. There is something disheartening about studying Chinese
 characters at age fifty-one. I studied fifty-five characters in a book, turned the page, and it said, "End
 of first grade." I was proud of my accomplishment--I had achieved first grade level. 
 <br><br>
 The character for "listening attentively" consists of five characters: the character for ear, the
 character for standing still, the character for ten, the character for eye, and the character for heart or
 mind. Chinese characters are really picturegrams: they are pictures that have evolved to describe a
 certain situation. This picturegram for listening attentively means: "When in stillness, one listens with
 the heart. The ear is worth ten eyes." 
 <br><br>
 The character for sacred, holy, or saint is made up of three characters: the character for ear, the
 character for hole (which is taken phonetically to mean clear), and the character for standing still.
 Thus, a saint is one who, in stillness, hears clearly; or, what is holy or sacred is being able to hear
 clearly, which evolves to being able to hear the word of God or being able to hear the sound of
 Buddha's voice. 
 <br><br>
 Listening is fundamental to our practice. Our school is called the Kwan Um School of Zen. "Kwan
 Um" means "perceive sound," or to listen. Kwan Seum Bosal, the bodhisattva of compassion,
 realized her enlightenment by hearing the sound of human suffering--through listening, through this
 human practice of hearing. 
 <br><br>
 In our own lives, we know that we hear clearly relative to the clarity of our mind. When our mind is
 cluttered or troubled, our hearing is distorted. Indeed all sense data becomes distorted with an
 unclear mind. There is a psychological practice, a game, where you sit with ten or fifteen people.
 One person whispers something in the ear of the first person, and the whispering goes all the way
 around. When it comes out at the other end, it is very unlike what was said initially. Our practice is
 to clear the mind in such a way that we can hear clearly. We want to hear clearly so that we can
 function correctly. 
 <br><br>
 In our Korean tradition, Chinul talks about tracing the radiance back. This is the practice of listening
 to the very sound of listening itself: to be able to sit with one's own mind, not following the mind
 and all of the tangents that it offers, but to sit quietly and listen. At first, we sit down and our minds
 begin to settle like dirt settles on a dirt road after a car goes by. There is some clarity. Then we begin
 to listen to our own fundamental nature. Having heard our own fundamental nature, we begin to
 listen to our friend, whoever that is. Listening to our friend is not complete without some action,
 some response. There is no true listening if our listening is limited to our own particular experience.
 The true practice of listening requires some kind of compassionate action."
