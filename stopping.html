 Stopping and Seeing</strong><br>

 "There are many paths for entering the reality of Nirvana, but in essence they are all
      contained with two practices: stopping and seeing.
 <br><br>
      Stopping is the primary gate for overcoming the bonds of compulsiveness. Seeing is the
      essential requisite for ending confusion.
 <br><br>
      Stopping is the wholesome resource that nurtures the mind. Seeing is the marvelous art
      which fosters intuitive understanding.
 <br><br>
      Stopping is the effective cause of attaining concentrative repose. Seeing is the very basis
      of enlightened wisdom.
 <br><br>
      A person who attains both concentration and wisdom has all the requisites for self-help and
      for helping others... It should be known, then, that these two techniques are like the two
      wheels of a chariot, the two wings of a bird. If their practice is lopsided, you will fall from the
      path. Therefore, the sutra says: To one-sidedly cultivate the merits of concentrative repose
      without practicing understanding is called dullness. To one-sidedly cultivate knowledge
      without practicing repose is called being crazed. Dullness and craziness, although they are
      somewhat different, are the same in that they both perpetuate an unwholesome
      perspective."
