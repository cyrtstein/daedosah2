 "There is no point in much talk,<br>
 But the beginner needs various things.<br>
 One should abandon either welcoming or sending off thoughts of past and future.<br>
 The instantaneous mind of nowness<br>
 Is the unfabricated innate nature.<br>
 In meditation there should be no trace of deliberateness.<br>
 One should not stray for an instant in confusion.<br>
 Nonwandering, nonmeditation, nonfabrication are the point.<br>
 With freshness, looseness and clarity,<br>
 In the space of the three gates of liberation,<br>
 One is mindful, establishing proper watchfulness.<br>
 Always keeping the mind balanced between tight and relaxed,<br>
 One pacifies the accumulation of subtle, tangible, and gross thoughts.<br>
 Rest in the state of natural, unfabricated mind....<br><br>
 Like the center of a cloudless sky,<br>
 the self-luminous mind is impossible to express.<br>
 It is wisdom of non-thought beyond analogy,<br>
 Naked ordinary mind.<br>
 Not keeping to dogmatism or arrogance,<br>
 It is clearly seen as dharmakaya.<br>
 The appearance of the six sense objects, like the moon in water,<br>
 Shines in the state of wisdom.<br>
 <strong>Whatever arises is the unfabricated innate state.<br>
 Whatever appears is the nature of mahamudra.</strong><br>
 The phenomenal world is dharmakaya great bliss."
